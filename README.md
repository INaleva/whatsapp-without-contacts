Enter a phone number to open a whatsapp chat without manually adding the number to the phone book.
(currently supported only israeli numbers starting with +972).

Please use format 05X-1234567 or 05X1234567.


Open by running the .pyw file.

If for some reason the gui doesn't open, make sure you have python 3 installed, and then do the following:

1. Right-click a .pyw file.

2. In the menu that pops up, go to Open with.

3. In the submenu that pops up, click on Choose default program...

4. A window will then appear. In this window, click on the Browse... button.

5. Then, go find the Python execuatble. It should be at C:\Python33\python3.3.exe, or at C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs (There might be multiple pythonX.exe files. If one doesn't work, try another.)

6. Once you select it, click Open.
